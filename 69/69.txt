The totient function of a number n measures the number of relatively prime integers less than n.

But, what we really want is a maximum of n/totient(n) where n <= 1_000_000. Meaning, we want totient(n) to be minimized.

totient(n) is small when n has many prime divisiors.

So, we can generate a number that is less than or equal to 1_000_000 with a lot of prime divisors!

Simply multiply primes: 2 * 3 * 5 * ...

It turns out the largest number less than equal to 1_000_000 generated in this way is 510,510 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 11 * 13 * 17.

510,510 is our solution.

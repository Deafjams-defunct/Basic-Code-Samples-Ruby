A Pythagorean Triple $(a,b,c)$ is defined by two integers $n$ and $m$ such that $m > n$ by Euclid's Formula. Assuming:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$a = 2mn, ~b = m^2 - n^2, ~c = m^2 + n^2$$
In the problem, we're given an additional condition $a + b + c = 1000$, so we have the system:
$$
\begin{cases}
	a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    \\
	a + b + c = 1000
    \\
\end{cases}
$$
Substituting Euclid's form into the second equation, we get the equation:
$$m(m+n) = 500$$
Which has 12 integer solutions, with some checking we find that $m = 20$ and $n = 5$ yield

$$a = 200, ~b = 375, ~c = 425$$
$$\implies a + b + c = 200 + 375 + 425 = 1000$$
$$\implies a^2 + b^2 = 40000 + 140625 = 180625 = c^2$$

Our solution is the product $abc = 31875000$.

1. Convert the triangle text into a csv file and load into Numbers or Excel.
2. Color cells based on their values. I chose:
    if cell > 90, color blue
    if cell > 70, color teal
    if cell > 50, color green
    if cell > 30, color yellow
    if cell > 10, color orange
    if cell > 0, color red
    
3. From top and and bottom, manually highlight paths with large numbers in them
    Note: valid moves from bottom are: cell above and cell left of above, and from top: down or right of down
    
4. Connect promising top and bottom paths. Highlight entire path.
5. Numbers or Excel give sum totals of highlighted cells. The path with highest sum isn't hard to find.
